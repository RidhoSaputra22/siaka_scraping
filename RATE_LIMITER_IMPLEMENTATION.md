# Rate Limiter Storage Implementation for Shared Hosting

## Problem Solved
The Flask-Limiter warning:
```
UserWarning: Using the in-memory storage for tracking rate limits as no storage was explicitly specified. This is not recommended for production use.
```

This warning occurred because Flask-Limiter was using in-memory storage by default, which loses data when the application restarts and doesn't work well in production environments.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Multi-Storage Backend Support**
The application now supports three storage options:

- **File-based (SQLite)** - **Recommended for shared hosting**
- **Redis** - For VPS/dedicated servers with Redis available  
- **Memory** - For development only

### 2. **File-Based Storage (Default)**
- Uses SQLite database for persistence
- Perfect for shared hosting (cPanel) environments
- Stores rate limit data in `data/rate_limits.db`
- Survives application restarts
- No external dependencies required

### 3. **Automatic Fallback System**
```
Redis (if available) â†’ File-based â†’ Memory (fallback)
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables (.env)
```bash
# Rate Limiter Storage Configuration
RATE_LIMITER_STORAGE=file          # Options: file, redis, memory
RATE_LIMITER_FILE_PATH=data/rate_limits.db
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
```

### For Shared Hosting (cPanel)
Use the default file-based storage:
```bash
RATE_LIMITER_STORAGE=file
```

### For VPS with Redis
```bash
RATE_LIMITER_STORAGE=redis
REDIS_URL=redis://your-redis-server:6379/0
```

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Custom SQLite Storage Class
```python
class FileLimiterStorage:
    """SQLite-based storage for Flask-Limiter - suitable for shared hosting"""
    
    def __init__(self, db_path='data/rate_limits.db'):
        # Creates SQLite database with rate_limits table
        # Thread-safe with locks
        # Auto-cleanup of expired entries
```

### 2. Storage Selection Logic
```python
def get_limiter_storage():
    """Get appropriate storage backend for rate limiter"""
    # 1. Try Redis if configured
    # 2. Fall back to file-based storage
    # 3. Use memory as last resort
```

### 3. Rate Limiting Configuration
```python
limiter = Limiter(
    key_func=get_remote_address,
    default_limits=["30 per hour", "5 per minute"],
    storage_uri=selected_backend
)
```

## Files Modified

1. **requirements.txt** - Added `redis==5.0.1`
2. **config.py** - Added rate limiter configuration options
3. **app.py** - Implemented multi-storage backend system
4. **.env.example** - Added rate limiter configuration examples

## Benefits for Shared Hosting

### âœ… **Advantages**
- **No external dependencies** required (SQLite is built into Python)
- **Persistent storage** survives application restarts
- **Thread-safe** for multiple concurrent requests
- **Auto-cleanup** of expired rate limit entries
- **Zero configuration** - works out of the box
- **Small footprint** - minimal disk usage

### ðŸ”§ **Production Ready**
- **Logging** shows which storage backend is being used
- **Error handling** with graceful fallbacks
- **Status endpoint** reports storage type
- **Thread-safe** SQLite operations

## Verification

### Check Storage Type
Visit: `http://your-app/api/status`
```json
{
  "data": {
    "rate_limiter_storage": "File-based SQLite",
    ...
  }
}
```

### Check Rate Limiting
Make multiple rapid requests to any endpoint. You should see HTTP 429 responses when limits are exceeded.

## For Your cPanel Deployment

1. **Upload all files** to your shared hosting
2. **Set environment variables** in your hosting control panel:
   ```
   RATE_LIMITER_STORAGE=file
   ```
3. **Ensure data directory** is writable
4. **The warning will be gone** and rate limiting will persist across restarts

## Migration Notes

- **Existing installations**: The change is backward compatible
- **No data loss**: Rate limits will start fresh with the new storage
- **No downtime**: Can be deployed as a direct replacement
- **Monitoring**: Check `/api/status` to confirm storage backend

The implementation automatically detects your environment and chooses the best storage option available, with file-based storage being the default for maximum compatibility with shared hosting providers.
